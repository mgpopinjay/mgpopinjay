### Hi there, I am Phil 👋

I work at the intersection of AI, Human Factors, and Policy.  My mission is to facilitate a human-machine relationship that is sustainable, productive, and fun.

- 🎓  I am a graduate student at UT Austin, currently based at the [Center for Autonomous Marine Operations and Systems](https://www.ntnu.edu/amos) of NTNU in Norway.
- 🔬 My research explore the application of autonomous systems and ways for them to better interact and support humans across diverse scenarios. 
- 💡 I am passionate about creating [unlikely partnership](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/city-robotics-hackathon/) across sectors to help organizations acquire complimentary capabilities for innovation.
- 🧑🏽‍🔬 I previously worked at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ptinn/projects/) and continue to support various projects there.

If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:ptinn@mit.edu).
