### Hi there, I am Phil 👋

I work at the intersection of AI, Human Factors, and Policy.  
My mission is to make the co-existence of humans and machines sustainable, productive, and fun.

- 🔬  My research explores the application of agentic/autonomous systems and ways for them to better interact with and support humans across diverse scenarios. 
- 💡  I am passionate about creating [unlikely partnerships](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/city-robotics-hackathon/) across sectors to help organizations acquire complementary capabilities for innovation.
- 🧑🏽‍🔬  I previously worked at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ptinn/projects/) and continue to support various projects there.

If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:ptinn@mit.edu).
